# MEteorit
Mixtures-of-ExperTs modEling for cOmplex and non-noRmal dIsTributions

MEteoritS is a toolbox containg several original and flexible mixtures-of-experts models to model, cluster and classify heteregenous data in many complex situations where the data are distributed according non-normal, possibly skewed distributions, and when they might be corrupted by atypical observations. The toolbox contains in particular sparse mixture-of-experts models for high-dimensional data. 


Our (dis-)covered meteorites are for instance the following:

NMoE

NNMoE

tMoE

StMoE

.

.

RMoE


The models and algorithms are developped and written in Matlab by Faicel Chamroukhi, and translated and designed into R packages by Florian Lecocq, Marius Bartcus and Faicel Chamroukhi.
