# **MEteorits:** Mixtures-of-ExperTs modEling for cOmplex and non-noRmal dIsTributions

MEteoritS is an open source toolbox (available in R and Matlab) containg 
several original and flexible mixtures-of-experts models to model, cluster and
classify heteregenous data in many complex situations where the data are 
distributed according to non-normal and possibly skewed distributions, and 
when they might be corrupted by atypical observations. The toolbox also 
contains sparse mixture-of-experts models for high-dimensional data.

Our (dis-)covered meteorits are for instance the following ones:

* NMoE;
* tMoE;
* SNMoE;
* StMoE.

The models and algorithms are developped and written in Matlab by Faicel 
Chamroukhi, and translated and designed into R packages by Florian Lecocq, 
Marius Bartcus and Faicel Chamroukhi.

# Installation

You can install the development version of MEteorits from [GitHub](https://github.com/fchamroukhi/MEteorits) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fchamroukhi/MEteorits")
```

To build *vignettes* for examples of usage, type the command below instead:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fchamroukhi/MEteorits", 
                         build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), 
                         build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Use the following command to display vignettes:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
browseVignettes("meteorits")
```

# Usage

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(meteorits)
```
