\usage{
sampleUnivSTMoE(alphak, betak, sigmak, lambdak, nuk, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{alphak}{The parameters of the gating network. \code{alphak} is a matrix of
size \emph{(q + 1, K - 1)}, with \emph{K - 1}, the number of regressors
(experts) and \emph{q} the order of the logistic regression}

\item{betak}{Matrix of size \emph{(p + 1, K)} representing the regression
coefficients of the experts network.}

\item{sigmak}{Vector of length \emph{K} giving the standard deviations of
the experts network.}

\item{lambdak}{Vector of length \emph{K} giving the skewness parameter of
each experts.}

\item{nuk}{Vector of length \emph{K} giving the degrees of freedom of the
experts network t densities.}

\item{x}{A vector og length \emph{n} representing the inputs (predictors).}
}
\value{
A list with the output variable \code{y} and statistics.
\itemize{
\item y Vector of length \emph{n} giving the output variable.
\item zi A vector of size \emph{n} giving the hidden label of the
expert component generating the i-th observation. Its elements are
\eqn{zi[i] = k}, if the i-th observation has been generated by the
k-th expert.
\item z A matrix of size \emph{(n, K)} giving the values of the binary
latent component indicators \eqn{Z_{ik}}{Zik} such that
\eqn{Z_{ik} = 1}{Zik = 1} iff \eqn{Z_{i} = k}{Zi = k}.
\item stats A list whose elements are:
\itemize{
\item Ey_k Matrix of size \emph{(n, K)} giving the conditional
expectation of Yi the output variable given the value of the
hidden label of the expert component generating the ith observation
\emph{zi = k}, and the value of predictor \emph{X = xi}.
\item Ey Vector of length \emph{n} giving the conditional expectation
of Yi given the value of predictor \emph{X = xi}.
\item Vary_k Vector of length \emph{k} representing the conditional
variance of Yi given \emph{zi = k}, and \emph{X = xi}.
\item Vary Vector of length \emph{n} giving the conditional expectation
of Yi given \emph{X = xi}.
